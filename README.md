## A POC (PROOF OF CONCEPT) submitted to 19th INDO-US mathematical chemistry conference and won best research award.

This application used bruteforce technique which is widely used in hacking to crack passwords.
We use brute force strategy to attach fragments to the core structure and create new molecules which can be tesed for activity
